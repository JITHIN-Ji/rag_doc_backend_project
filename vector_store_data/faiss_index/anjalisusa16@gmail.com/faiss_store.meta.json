Introduction & Purpose \nThis document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the \"Hey \nPebble AI Concierge,\" an AI-powered assistant designed to enhance the event experience on \nthe Pebble platform. The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core value proposition: \nautomating attendee support to reduce the load on human staff and improve attendee \nsatisfaction. \n2.

This leads to long wait \ntimes at info booths, staff burnout, and a diminished attendee experience. Attendees struggle to \nget quick, consistent answers to their questions, causing frustration and wasted time. \n3.
