Its development has\nbeen shaped by key milestones, leading to its status as a leading automation tool. Over the years,\nSelenium has become a trusted solution for developers and testers due to its flexibility, cross-\nbrowser compatibility, and open-source nature. This overview is divided into two key subtopics:\nThe Origins of Selenium and The Evolution of Selenium into WebDriver.\n4.1\nTHE ORIGINS OF SELENIUM\nSelenium was first introduced in 2004 by Jason Huggins and Paul Hammant at Thought-\nWorks.

Unlike its predecessor, WebDriver worked directly with browsers, offering faster,\nmore reliable, and more flexible testing. It could interact with browser elements at a deeper level,\nmaking it ideal for testing dynamic and highly interactive web applications.\nIn 2011, Selenium Core and WebDriver were combined into Selenium 2.0, marking a major\nturning point. This merger brought the best features of both tools together, creating a powerful,\nunified framework for automated testing. Selenium 2.0 introduced cross-browser compatibility,\nparallel testing, and better support for modern web technologies, enabling testers to efficiently test\napplications on various browsers and platforms.\nWith the release of Selenium 3.0 in 2016, the framework underwent significant improve-\nments.

Unlike its predecessor, WebDriver worked directly with browsers, offering faster,\nmore reliable, and more flexible testing. It could interact with browser elements at a deeper level,\nmaking it ideal for testing dynamic and highly interactive web applications.\nIn 2011, Selenium Core and WebDriver were combined into Selenium 2.0, marking a major\nturning point. This merger brought the best features of both tools together, creating a powerful,\nunified framework for automated testing. Selenium 2.0 introduced cross-browser compatibility,\nparallel testing, and better support for modern web technologies, enabling testers to efficiently test\napplications on various browsers and platforms.\nWith the release of Selenium 3.0 in 2016, the framework underwent significant improve-\nments.

It provides automation capabilities, cross-browser compatibil-\nity, and supports multiple programming languages, making it convenient for developers and\ntesters. Selenium Core, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid are the key components\nthat enable efficient test script development, execution, and parallel testing across different\nmachines. However, it\u2019s important to be aware of the limitations and challenges associ-\nated with Selenium. It may have limited support for desktop applications, cross-domain\nsecurity restrictions, and complex test maintenance requirements. Additionally, Selenium\u2019s\ncompatibility with browser versions, the need for test script development skills, and its fo-\ncus on web-based testing should be taken into consideration. Nevertheless, the Selenium\ncommunity and available resources provide immense support for testers. Online",

Its development has\nbeen shaped by key milestones, leading to its status as a leading automation tool. Over the years,\nSelenium has become a trusted solution for developers and testers due to its flexibility, cross-\nbrowser compatibility, and open-source nature. This overview is divided into two key subtopics:\nThe Origins of Selenium and The Evolution of Selenium into WebDriver.\n4.1\nTHE ORIGINS OF SELENIUM\nSelenium was first introduced in 2004 by Jason Huggins and Paul Hammant at Thought-\nWorks.

Unlike its predecessor, WebDriver worked directly with browsers, offering faster,\nmore reliable, and more flexible testing. It could interact with browser elements at a deeper level,\nmaking it ideal for testing dynamic and highly interactive web applications.\nIn 2011, Selenium Core and WebDriver were combined into Selenium 2.0, marking a major\nturning point. This merger brought the best features of both tools together, creating a powerful,\nunified framework for automated testing. Selenium 2.0 introduced cross-browser compatibility,\nparallel testing, and better support for modern web technologies, enabling testers to efficiently test\napplications on various browsers and platforms.\nWith the release of Selenium 3.0 in 2016, the framework underwent significant improve-\nments.

Its development has\nbeen shaped by key milestones, leading to its status as a leading automation tool. Over the years,\nSelenium has become a trusted solution for developers and testers due to its flexibility, cross-\nbrowser compatibility, and open-source nature. This overview is divided into two key subtopics:\nThe Origins of Selenium and The Evolution of Selenium into WebDriver.\n4.1\nTHE ORIGINS OF SELENIUM\nSelenium was first introduced in 2004 by Jason Huggins and Paul Hammant at Thought-\nWorks.

Unlike its predecessor, WebDriver worked directly with browsers, offering faster,\nmore reliable, and more flexible testing. It could interact with browser elements at a deeper level,\nmaking it ideal for testing dynamic and highly interactive web applications.\nIn 2011, Selenium Core and WebDriver were combined into Selenium 2.0, marking a major\nturning point. This merger brought the best features of both tools together, creating a powerful,\nunified framework for automated testing. Selenium 2.0 introduced cross-browser compatibility,\nparallel testing, and better support for modern web technologies, enabling testers to efficiently test\napplications on various browsers and platforms.\nWith the release of Selenium 3.0 in 2016, the framework underwent significant improve-\nments.
